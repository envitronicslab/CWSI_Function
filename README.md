# Calculation of Theoretical CWSI in Real-Time
This repository provides required functions to calculate theoretical valaues for CWSI, actual transpiration (Ta) and potential transpiration (Tp) using microclimate data and surface canopy temperatures. The functions are currently calibrated for apple trees, however, they can be modified and/or re-calibrated to work with other fruit trees or crops. Obviously, any change to the equations needs to take the plant physiology into consideration. 

The equations are extracted from the following research papers:

## How to compile/build and run the C++ program (Linux only)
The CWSI_Function has only been tested on Linux (Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS). A fully functional application on any other OS or OS version is not guaranteed. To find the OS name and version in Linux, run any of the following commands:
```
cat /etc/os-release
lsb_release -a
hostnamectl
```

To test the program, open a terminal window and type the follwoing commands:
```
cd CWSI_Function
chmod u+x run.sh
./run.sh
```

You should see the following output in the terminal:
```
*********** CWSI Model Test **********
CWSI (cal) = 0.216767
CWSI (exp) = 0.216767

Test passed!
